# data_pipeline
#### Ntigkaris E. Alexandros
#### Python v.3.9.2

We implement and automate a data pipeline, beginning with flat-file ingestion, parsing and eventually traversing through every layer of the data warehouse.

To use, provide the correct value for each parameter in the setup file and then pass the file as argument in:
python ./main.py xxxx/setup.json
